# Streaming POC

This is a Proof-of-Concept to demonstrate the native browser capabilities with pure Javascript.

### Running locally
1. Create an account and get a free API key from the Groq service [here](https://console.groq.com/keys).
2. Populate the key in the config.js file.
3. Run any HTTP server, such as `live-server` for example:
```bash
npx live-server
```
